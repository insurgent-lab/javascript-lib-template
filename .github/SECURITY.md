# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report it at <{{SECURITY_POLICY_EMAIL}}>.

Please encrypt your message to us using our PGP key. The key fingerprint is:

```
{{SECURITY_POLICY_PGP_FINRGERPRINT}}
```

The key is available from [{{SECURITY_POLICY_PGP_KEYSERVER}}]({{SECURITY_POLICY_PGP_URL}}).

Please include the requested information listed below (as much as you can provide) to help us better understand the nature and scope of the possible issue:

- Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
- The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit the issue

Please get in touch and give the project contributors a chance to resolve the vulnerability and issue a new release prior to any public exposure; this helps protect the project's users and provides them with a chance to upgrade and/or update in order to protect their applications.
